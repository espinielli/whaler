# whaler

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of whaler is to
â€¦

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of whaler from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("whaler") -->

<!-- ``` -->

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uncoast-unconf/whaler")
```

## Todo

In the dockerfile generation, we sill need set\_\* functions for: - CMD
- ADD - COPY - ENTRYPOINT - VOLUME - USER - WORKDIR - ARG - ONBUILD -
STOPSIGNAL - HEALTHCHECK - SHELL

And we have set\_\* functions for: - ENV - EXPOST - FROM - LABEL -
RUN

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->

<!-- library(whaler) -->

<!-- ## basic example code -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
